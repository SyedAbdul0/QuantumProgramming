#  Our friend Asiay has one euro and one cent. Both coins are biased, and the probabilities of getting heads and tails are as follows:
#      one euro: heads with probability $ 0.6 $ and tails with probability $ 0.4 $. 
#      one cent: heads with probability $ 0.3 $ and tails with probability $ 0.7 $. 


# Asiay flips her coins based on the following protocol:  
#      she starts with flipping one euro[*]; 
#      whenever she gets heads, she flips one euro in the next round; and, 
#      whenever she gets tails, she flips one cent in the next round.
     
     
# Suppose that Asja secretly tosses her coins based on the defined protocol.By using python, we can calculate the probabilities of Asja seeing heads and tails after three coin tosses

# initial condition:
# Asja will start with one euro,
#    and so, we assume that the probability of having head is 1 at the beginning.
