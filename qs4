Write a function to implement the described biased coin,The inputs are integers N>0 and Bâˆˆ{0,â€¦,N}.The output is either "Heads" or "Tails". 

Solution:

def biased_coin(N,B):
    from random import randrange
    random_number = randrange(N)
    if random_number < B:
        return "Heads"
    else:
        return "Tails"
